# miniJava
Collaborative development of a compiler for a simplified Java-based language—majority front-end development with the use of ANTLR for lexer, parser, and semantic actions as well as Java for the AST structure and grammar rules. The major take-away from this project was that I left with an in-depth, system-level understanding of the computer—we gained experience in user interface, a functional understanding of Java, and the ability to convert MiniJava code into assembly code, specifically for the Java Virtual Machine. It was also great working in pairs because I found that where I had difficulties on the project, my partner was able to pick up the slack, and often we would teach each other the parts we had trouble understanding. This project was definitely one of the larger ones I've done, with over 16,000 lines of code and over 300 commits to the repository over the course of three months; it involved a lot of problem solving and hours of collaborative work every weekend.
